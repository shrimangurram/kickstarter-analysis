## Analysis Report
In helping Louise analyze the data for theater related campaigns, the following can be deduced from the data analysis performed:
* The plays subcategory had the maximum number of campagins - 1066 out of which 694 were successful and 353 failed. The other subcategories of musicals and spaces had an approximate 50% success and failure rate:

* Further analysis based on launch date for campaigns related to theater showed that success rate was higher when the campaigns were launched in May/June time frame and going down towards the end of the year:

* Analyzing the date further for statistics for the theater/plays subcategory in the US based on goal and amount pledged, successfull campaigns had a mean goal of $5049 and a median goal of $3000 with a standard deviation of $7,749. ---
Based on amount pledged, successful campaigns had a mean pledged amount of $5602 and a median pledged amount of $3168 and a standard deviation of $8335

** Based on analysis, Louise should look to start her campaign for the play in the May/June time frame and target a goal around $3000 to be successful.

### Challenge
* Analyzing the data based on goals, campaigns that have had a goal of less than 5000 have had a much higher success rate and failure rates go up as the goal amount goes up. Campaigns whose goal amount has been higher than 45000 have a much higher failure rate: [Outcome based on goals](https://github.com/anshurathore11/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/OutcomesBasedonGoal.png)
* Further analysis based on launch date for campaigns related to theater showed that success rate was higher when the campaigns were launched in May/June time frame and going down towards the end of the year:
